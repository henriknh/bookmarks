Hello world!

### Getting started

First step is to install requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you need to edit _config.py_ and set up the _SECRET_KEY_

```
>>> import os
>>> os.urandom(24)
'\xfd{H\xe5<\x95\xf9\xe3\x96.5\xd1\x01O<!\xd5\xa2\xa0\x9fR"\xa1\xa8'

Just take that thing and copy/paste it into your code and you're done.
```

Thats it. You are done! 

For testing purposes you can start the service with `python main.py`
